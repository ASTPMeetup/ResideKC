# Your Trash Day

This project is up for adoption.

## Problem Statement

Trash Day Lookup App to assist new and existing residents in identifying their trash pickup day, recycling locations, and 
other *neighborhood-area services* (removed "trashy things" scs; another option "location-specific").

Are you looking to practice your new coding skills? This project is a
group study opportunity to build a trash day lookup app to assist new
and existing residents *to quickly learn about local services for their home.* (removed "in identifying their trash pickup day, recycling locations, and other trashy things." scs)
